                to collect any information from the Site or any other user of the Site. Except as noted above, you are
                not conveyed any right or license by implication, estoppel, or otherwise in or under a patent,
                trademark, copyright, or proprietary right of EasyFuel or any third party. You may not use any meta
                tags or any other "hidden text" utilizing EasyFuel's name, trademark, or product name without our
                express written consent. "Site information" means all materials on the Site, including, without
                limitation, trademarks, design, product description, HTML text, graphics, other files, photographs,
                codes, software layout, designs forms and the selection and arrangement thereof.<br><br>
                From time to time, EasyFuel may develop patches, updates, upgrades and other changes/modifications to
                improve the performance of the Services and/or software associated with use of the Services
                (collectively “Upgrades”). These may be automatically installed without providing you any further notice
                or requesting further consent from you. You hereby consent to such Upgrades. If you do not wish to
                receive Upgrades, your sole recourse is to terminate your Account and to stop using EasyFuel Services.
                You acknowledge that you may be required to install Upgrades to use the Services and you agree to
                promptly do so.<br><br>
                EasyFuel cannot ensure that unauthorized third parties will always be prevented from penetrating
                EasyFuel security measures or access your personal data for unauthorized use. You acknowledge that you
                provide your personal information at your own risk.<br><br>
                EasyFuel has the unilateral right at any point in time to modify, suspend or discontinue the Services
                or any part thereof with or without notice. You agree that EasyFuel will not be liable to you or to any
                third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services or any part thereof.<br><br>
                <h5>2. REGISTRATION OF ACCOUNT</h5>

                requested information about yourself. You agree to provide accurate and current information about
                yourself so that EasyFuel is able to provide superior service to you. You agree to notify EasyFuel
                whenever any of your previously-submitted information changes. EasyFuel shall not be held liable or
                responsible for Services which you do not receive as a result of your inability to provide updated
                information. Should you provide false or misleading information, or if EasyFuel perceives that you have
                provided false or misleading information, EasyFuel reserves the right to suspend or terminate your
                Account.<br><br>

                Personal Information with any third parties for their own use.<br><br>
                <h5>4. COOKIE POLICY</h5>

                This policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the Site.
                “Cookies” are text-only pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual’s hard drive or
                other web site-browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow the Site to remember
                information that will make your use of the Site more convenient. A cookie will typically contain the
                name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a randomly
                generated unique number or other value. Like most web sites, EasyFuel uses cookies for a variety of
                purposes in order to improve your online experience, for analytics and for marketing, but specifically
                we use Cookies on the Website for the following purposes:<br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Analytical Purposes: We use Cookies to analyze user activity in order to improve the Site. For
                        example, using Cookies we can look at aggregate patterns and can use such analysis to gain
                        insights about how to improve the functionality and user experience of the Site.
                    </li>
                    <li>Your Preferences: We use Cookies to store certain user preferences on our Site. For example, we
                        may store the recent searches you have performed in a Cookie so that we can allow you to easily
                        repeat those searches when you return to our Site.
                    </li>
                    <li>Marketing: We use Cookies from third-party partners for marketing purposes. These Cookies allow
                        us to display EasyFuel promotional material to you on other sites you visit across the
                        Internet.
                    </li>
                    <li>Referral Tracking: We use Cookies to associate user activity with the third party web site that
                        referred the user to our Site. We do not share any personal information or information about
                        individual user activities with these partner entities.
                    </li>
                    <li>Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you
                        leave the Website.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h5>5. LIMITATIONS OF EasyFuel SERVICES</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>(a) EasyFuel relies on or works with third party products and services. These third party
                        products and services are beyond EasyFuel’s control, but their operation may impact or be
                        impacted by the use and reliability of the EasyFuel Site. You acknowledge and agree that: (i)
                        the use and availability of the Services is dependent on third party product vendors and service
                        providers; (ii) these third party products and services may not operate in a reliable manner all
                        of the time, and they may impact the way that EasyFuel Services operate; and (iii) EasyFuel is
                        not responsible for damages and losses due to the operation of these third party products and
                        services.
                    </li>
                    <li>(b) You acknowledge that the availability of certain Services is dependent on: (i) your
                        computer, mobile device, home wiring, home Wi-Fi network, Bluetooth connection, and other
                        related equipment (“Equipment”); (ii) your Internet service provider (“ISP”); and (iii) your
                        mobile device carrier (“Carrier”). You acknowledge that you are responsible for all fees charged
                        by your ISP and Carrier in connection with your use of the Services. You also acknowledge that
                        you are responsible for compliance with all applicable agreements, terms of use/service, and
                        other policies of your ISP and Carrier.
                    </li>
                    <li>(c) Some EasyFuel Services may provide the opportunity for you to interface with products and
                        services created, owned and operated by third parties (“Third Party Products”). You acknowledge
                        that Third Party Products that you connect to your account or interface with are not owned, or
                        operated by EasyFuel, and you acknowledge and agree that EasyFuel does not control, and that
                        these Terms and Conditions do not apply to, any Third Party Products. Use of any Third Party
                        Products may be governed by separate terms and conditions provided by the operator(s) of the
                        applicable Third Party Products. You acknowledge and agree that EasyFuel makes no
                        representation or warranty about the safety of any Third Party Products. Accordingly, EasyFuel
                        is not responsible for your use of any Third Party Products or any personal injury, death,
                        property damage (including, without limitation, to your home), or other harm or losses arising
                        from or relating to your use of any Third Party Products. Questions about Third Party Products
                        should be directed to such third parties.
                    </li>
                    <li>(d) The Site may contain links to other web sites operated by third parties (“Third Party
                        Sites”) and referrals to third party vendors (“Referred Vendors”). Such Third Party Sites and
                        Referred Vendors are not under EasyFuel’s control. EasyFuel provides these links and referrals
                        only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any
                        representations with respect to such Third Party Sites or Referred Vendors. Your use of these

                <ul>
                    <li>(a) If a dispute (the “Dispute”) arises between you and EasyFuel, EasyFuel deems it paramount
                        to learn and resolve your concerns. You agree you will contact EasyFuel concerning any dispute
                        you have with EasyFuel regarding these Terms and Conditions or EasyFuel’s Products and/or
                        Services by contacting EasyFuel at 503-538-2513.
                    </li>
                    <li>(b) You and EasyFuel agree to submit any claim, dispute, action, cause of action, issue, or
                        request for relief arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions or your use of the
                        Services to binding arbitration rather than by filing any lawsuit in any forum other than set
                        forth in this section. Further, you agree arbitration is final and binding and subject to only
                        very limited review by a court. You also waive your right to any form of appeal, review or
                        recourse to any court or other judicial authority, insofar as such waiver may be validly made.
                        This provision is to be interpreted broadly to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of
                        or relating to your use of the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration except that you
                        may take all claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court.
                    </li>
                    <li>(c) No party may initially institute any civil action in the federal or state court system
                        concerning any Dispute under this Terms of Service. If you and EasyFuel are unable to agree on
                        the resolution of a Dispute within 60 days after you first present such claim to EasyFuel, then
                        either party may initiate the dispute resolution procedure described in this section by giving
                        the other party written notice, describing with reasonable specificity the Dispute, stating the
                        party’s proposed resolution of the Dispute, and referring to this Agreement. If the parties are
                        unable to negotiate an acceptable resolution of the Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date
                        of the notice, then any party may file suit in Washington County Circuit Court for the sole
                        purpose of referring the Dispute to a referee as provided in Oregon Rule of Civil Procedure
                        65.If a Dispute is referred to a referee,you agree that the presiding judge of the Washington
                        County Circuit Court may appoint a referee by selecting a referee from the reference judge panel
                        maintained by that Court. Within twenty (20) days after receiving notification of the selection
                        of the referee, either party may file with the presiding judge a written objection to the
                        referee selected and request that the presiding judge select another referee. Each party will be
                        allowed three objections and no more.The decision of the referee will be final and binding on
                        the parties, and may not be appealed to any forum. The referee’s findings resulting from the
                        proceeding may be confirmed, relief in accordance therewith obtained, and a final judgment
                        entered in the Washington County Circuit Court.
                    </li>
                    <li>(d) There shall be no right or authority for any claims subject to this arbitration clause to be
                        arbitrated on a class action or consolidated basis or on bases involving claims brought in a
                        purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public (including, but not limited
                        to, as a private attorney general).
                    </li>
                    <li>(e) All administrative fees and expenses of arbitration will be divided equally between you and
                        EasyFuel. Each party will bear the expense of its own counsel, experts, witnesses and
                        preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration hearing.
                    </li>

                    <li>(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, EasyFuel may seek injunctive relief or other equitable

                        regarding the use of the Services. Any failure by EasyFuel to exercise or enforce any right or
                        provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not operate as a waiver of such right or
                        provision. The section titles in these Terms and Conditions are for convenience only and have no
                        legal or contractual effect. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is, for any reason,

                        unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is
                        valid and enforceable to the maximum extent allowable by law.

                        otherwise transferred by you without EasyFuel’s prior written consent. These Terms and
                        Conditions may be assigned by EasyFuel without restriction. These Terms and Conditions are
                        binding upon any permitted assignee.
                    </li>
